\section{Statistical method for interpreting results}
\label{sec:statisticalMethod}

This section gives a description of the statistical methods used to interpret the results of section~\ref{sec:yields}.
The results are interpreted using expected exclusion limits and significance for the available benchmark points.

A binned likelihood fit is performed over analysis bins using the Higgs Combine tool~\cite{url:higgscombine}. 
For signal regions with a nonzero signal yield, the yield will be modified such that it is set to 10e-5.
A systematic uncertainty of 10\% is assumed for signal, based on the 8 TeV analysis, and is taken as correlated across all bins in the fit.

The expected exclusion limits at the 95\% CL are calculated using asymptotic \CLs (with a-priori expected background)~\cite{Cowan:2010js}:
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
combine -M Asymptotic datacard.txt --noFitAsimov -n stringForRootfileOutput
\end{verbatim}
}

Expected significances are calculated using a profile likelihood scan (with a-priori expected background):
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
combine -M ProfileLikelihood --significance datacard.txt -t 400 --expectSignal=1 -n stringForRootfileOutput
\end{verbatim}
}
The string shows the command using 400 toys in the scan.
